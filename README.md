## Description

_This app was created to count the number of times a word is used!.
Specs:
1. This app will accept a word from its user.
  example inputWord = "haa"
2. this app will then accept a group of words from the user.
  example inputSentance = "haa haahaa potato"
  user inputs are easy to test because i can have the console writeline the input to make sure it matches.
3. this app with split the group of words using .split so the words are a string[], so they can be compared them individually.
  Example splitSentance[] = "haa" "haahaa" "potato"
  This is easy to test because if it works i will get an input separated by "".
4. this app will loop through the string[] and compare the initial word to each word in the string[], and count how many times the word was listed.
  Example input 'haa' input 2 "haa" "haahaa" "potato" will result in a score of 1!

5. This app with tell the user how many times the initial word was repeated.
example you used your initial word 1 time(s).
